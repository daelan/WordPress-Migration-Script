#### Overview

This is a very simple script for streamlining the process of moving a WordPress site from one server to another.

All it really does is provide a simple means to update the domain specific entries in the database without having to manually do it in MySQL.

####How To use

**Before using this script you need to take care of migrating the files and database to the new web server. This script doesn't do that for you.**

1. Toss the migrate.php file in the root directory of the WordPress install.
2. Fill out the form with the relevant domain info and click the shiny migrate button.
3. Delete the migrate.php file from the server.
